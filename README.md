### Setup

* Work in teams to build a command line version of the dice game Ten Thousand by expanding your understanding of Python standard library.

### Feature Tasks and Requirements

create a Cookie Stand Admin app using Next.js and style using Tailwind CSS.

- The spec for lab is screen shot of Cookie Stand Admin Version 1
- pages/Index.js should…
- Have <Head> component with page title set to Cookie Stand Admin
- Have a header component that matches spec.
- Have a <main> component containing <form> and a placeholder component showing JSON string of last created Cookie Stand.
- Have a <footer> component that matches spec.
- Style app using TailwindCSS utility classes.

### Implementation Notes

- Follow Install Tailwind CSS with Next.js steps.
- NOTE: name your app cookie-stand-admin instead of my-project
- Strip out unused files: Won’t break if they get left in, but a good practice to remove stuff you’re not using.
